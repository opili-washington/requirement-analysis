Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for documenting the requirement analysis phase of a hotel booking management system, inspired by platforms like Airbnb. The purpose is to create a structured blueprint of functional and non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, and system architecture diagrams to ensure clarity, alignment with stakeholder expectations, and a solid foundation for software development. By applying industry-standard practices, this project aims to simulate real-world requirement analysis tasks, emphasizing precision, scalability, and user-centric design to meet the acceptance creteria.
