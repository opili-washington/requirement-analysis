#Requirement Analysis in Software Development

##Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for documenting the requirement analysis phase of a hotel booking management system, inspired by platforms like Airbnb. The purpose is to create a structured blueprint of functional and non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, and system architecture diagrams to ensure clarity, alignment with stakeholder expectations, and a solid foundation for software development. By applying industry-standard practices, this project aims to simulate real-world requirement analysis tasks, emphasizing precision, scalability, and user-centric design to meet the acceptance creteria.


#What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

Requirement analysis is the first step of the software development process and software development life cycle (SDLC).

Requirement analysis is all about understanding what software is supposed to do and the constraints it must operate within.

It is usually a technical process and a team effort where stakeholders and software developers determine the needs and conditions that a new or altered software product must meet. This process involves identifying, documenting, and analyzing these business requirements to ensure that they are clearly understood and feasible.

Why is this important?

Because getting this phase right means avoiding costly mistakes later on. If the foundation is weak or misaligned, everything built on it can crumble.
