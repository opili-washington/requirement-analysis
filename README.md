# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for documenting the requirement analysis phase of a hotel booking management system, inspired by platforms like Airbnb. The purpose is to create a structured blueprint of functional and non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, and system architecture diagrams to ensure clarity, alignment with stakeholder expectations, and a solid foundation for software development. By applying industry-standard practices, this project aims to simulate real-world requirement analysis tasks, emphasizing precision, scalability, and user-centric design to meet the acceptance creteria.


# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

Requirement analysis is the first step of the software development process and software development life cycle (SDLC).

Requirement analysis is all about understanding what software is supposed to do and the constraints it must operate within.

It is usually a technical process and a team effort where stakeholders and software developers determine the needs and conditions that a new or altered software product must meet. This process involves identifying, documenting, and analyzing these business requirements to ensure that they are clearly understood and feasible.

Why is this important?

Because getting this phase right means avoiding costly mistakes later on. If the foundation is weak or misaligned, everything built on it can crumble.


# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a critical SDLC phase where stakeholder needs for a hotel booking system are gathered, analyzed, and documented to define what the system does and how it performs. It ensures a shared understanding among customers, hotel managers, and developers, forming the foundation for development.

## why Requirement Analysis is critical in the SDLC.

Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.


# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

1. Requirement Gathering 
- Interviews: Conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.
- Surveys/Questionnaires: Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience.
- Workshops: Organizing workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements.
- Observation: Observing end-users in their working environment to understand their needs.
- Document Analysis: Reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.

2. Requirement Elicitation
- Brainstorming: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.
- Focus Groups: Holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
- Prototyping: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.

3. Requirement Documentation
- Requirement Specification Document: Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.
- User Stories: Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the userâ€™s perspective.
- Use Cases: Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.

4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
- Requirement Prioritization: Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.
- Feasibility Analysis: Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
- Modeling: Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.

5. Requirement Validation.
- Review and Approval: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Acceptance Criteria: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
- Traceability: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.


# Types of Requirements

## Functional Requirements
Describe what the system should do for instance;User authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.
* Customer Service (Search + Booking)
This is the service that will be given to customers. In this customers can search and book a hotel. Here customers have a separate portal to access the data and process it.

## Non-functional Requirements
Describe how the system should perform for example;  Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.
* Hotel Management Service
This is the service that will be given to hotel managers/owners. In this managers can manage their hotel's related information. Here managers have a separate portal to access the data and update it.


# Use Case Diagrams

## What Use Case Diagrams are 
Use case diagrams show how different users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases).

## The Benefits of use case diagrams
- Provide a clear visual representation of system functionalities.
- Help in identifying and organizing system requirements.
- Facilitate communication among stakeholders and development team.
